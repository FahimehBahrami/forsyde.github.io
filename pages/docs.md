Here on this page we tried gathering many of the ForSyDe documents (e.g. technical reports, tutorials, API documentations, etc.) scattered across the internet and grouping them by relevant topics. The purpose is to point to and help the interested reader to reach whatever information she might need without much hassle. As a general rule, here you find tool-oriented documentations. For associated scientific publications, please check our [Publications](publications) page.

# Design of Systems

Here we point to documentations on tools and frameworks for design-related activities, such as modeling, simulation, testing, etc. 

### General

These documents present a general view of ForSyDe modeling and/or go through multiple design frameworks and compares them. 

* [**The ForSyDe chapter**](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-94-017-7267-9_5.pdf) in the ["Handbook of Hardware/Software Codesign"](https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007%2F978-94-017-7267-9) ( [doi](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-7267-9_5) \| [pdf-url](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-94-017-7267-9_5.pdf) \| [ref](publications.html#SanJan2017a) \| [bib](publications_bib.html#SanJan2017a) ) is a slightly outdated but highly relevant introduction to ForSyDe modeling using different models of computation (MoC). It covers (a bit of) the basic ForSyDe principles, modeling, simulation, hardware synthesis and visualization and it introduces the [ForSyDe-Shallow](forsyde-shallow), [ForSyDe-Deep](forsyde-deep) and [ForSyDe-SystemC](ForSyDe-SystemC) frameworks.
