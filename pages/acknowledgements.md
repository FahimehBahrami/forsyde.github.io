# Acknowledgements

This site was published with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), using the [Slate Theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate). Much of the code has been inspired from the [Jekyll Bootstrap Doc](https://github.com/mistic100/jekyll-bootstrap-doc) and the [Jekyll Documentation Theme](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html) projects. 

Some icons are embedded using [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) fonts.
