# Overview

ForSyDe (**For**mal **Sy**stem **De**sign) is a methodology with a formal basis for modeling and design of heterogeneous embedded and cyber-physical systems. It is supported by a set of tools, modeling libraries, and related documentation. ForSyDe uses the theory of models of computation (MoCs) for capturing heterogeneity formally. 

ForSyDe models can be an entry point to different design flows among them:

 * design space exploration based on constraint programming.
 * transformational design refinement.
 * refinement by replacement using the concept of co-simulation wrappers.
 * Y-chart-based system synthesis.
 * GPGPU software synthesis.

# The ForSyDe Methodology

The ForSyDe methodology has been developed with the objective to move system design (i.e. System on Chip, Hardware and Software systems) to a higher level of abstraction and to bridge the abstraction gap by transformational design refinement.

ForSyDe is based on carefully selected formal foundations. First, the designer must supply a initial specification model, which

 * Can mix different Models of Computation (MoCs) i.e. Synchronous MoC, Untimed MoC ...
 * Is modelled by a network of processes interconnected by signals. Each process is created by a process constructor, allowing to separate communication and computation.
