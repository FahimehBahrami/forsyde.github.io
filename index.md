# Overview

ForSyDe is a methodology with a formal basis for modeling and design of heterogeneous systems-on-chip and cyber-physical systems that has been developed with the following objectives:

 * System design must start at a high level of abstraction. The designer shall focus on functionality, and low-level implementation details shall not be an issue at the design stage;
 * Design methodology must give a solid base for the incorporation of formal methods. This means that verification must be a first class citizen _from the start_;
 * Abstraction gap between specification and implementation must be bridged by formal refinement techniques.

## Our Name

ForSyDe is officially an acronym for **For**mal **Sy**stem **De**sign.

ForSyDe also resembles with the word _foresight_. According to the [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/foresight) dictionary

> **foresight** noun  
> [fore·​sight] ; [\ˈfȯr-ˌsīt\]
>
> Definition of _foresight_ 
>
> 1. an act or the power of foreseeing : prescience   
>    _Through foresight she could tell what the outcome would be._
>
> 2. provident care : prudence  
>    _had the foresight to invest his money wisely_
>
> 3. an act of looking forward  
>    also : a view forward

This definition captures the essence of our vision: formal design should pave a clear way towards a correct implementation. Through a formal model a designer can thus _foresee_ the desired system realization. This is also the story behind our logo.

## Our Vision

ForSyDe envisions a correct-by-construction design flow by combining:

 * Modelling framework based on theory of models of computation;
 * Predictable platforms providing guarantees for extra functional properties.

The design flow can be sketched as below:

</p>

The key components of the design flow are:

 * **Formally analysable application** models based on a formal foundation to enable formal analysis and reasoning;
 * **Predictable platforms** providing service guarantees;
 * **Analysis methods** enabling powerful design tools;
 * **Design entry language** based on the formal foundation enabling
   - Simulation of the application model;
   - Automatic abstraction of formal analysable model.
