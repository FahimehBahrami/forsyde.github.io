# ForSyDe-Shallow Update

[ForSyDe-Shallow](https://github.com/forsyde/forsyde-shallow) has been updated to version 3.3.3, which adds the following features:

* a modeling library for the scenario-aware dataflow (SADF) MoC
* a modeling library for the cyclo-static data flow (CSDF) MoC

Currently, this version of ForSyDe-Shallow is only available as a nightly build. We are currently working on the [3.4.0 release](https://github.com/forsyde/forsyde-shallow/milestone/2), which will be available through [HackageDB](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/browse).
In the meantime we will keep you up to date.

In the following days an SADF example will also be added to the [forsyde-shallow-examples](https://github.com/forsyde/forsyde-shallow-examples) repository.
