# The ForSyDe Web Site is Growing

We conclude a very busy and intense year, 2018, with announcing some new web content which has finally been compiled together or migrated from old repositories. We are still in the (long) process of exposing and documenting our tools and methods better, and the progress can only done in "baby steps" due to the ruthless workloads here in academia. Nevertheless, we proudly present that:

* [The ForSyDe welcome page](https://forsyde.github.io/index.html) has now relevant content.
* The [ForSyDe-Shallow](https://forsyde.github.io/forsyde-shallow/) project has finally received an own page.
* The same goes for [ForSyDe-Deep](https://forsyde.github.io/forsyde-deep/) which has also a web page gathering important resources.

# New Public Releases

As of recent tool maintenance, we have published the following Haskell packages on [HackageDB](https://hackage.haskell.org/):

* [ForSyDe-Shallow v.3.3.3](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/forsyde-shallow-3.3.3.0) adding the CSDF and SADF MoCs, contribution by [Ricardo Bonna](https://github.com/ricardobonna);
* [ForSyDe-Deep v.0.2](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/forsyde-deep-0.2.0) is finally on HackageDB;
* the old [ForSyDe](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ForSyDe) package has been formally tagged as deprecated in favor of the aforementioned ones.
