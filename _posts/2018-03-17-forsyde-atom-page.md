# A new web page for the ForSyDe-Atom project

Continuing our (by now) established routine of publishing web pages every few days, we are happy to announce the new  [ForSyDe-Atom](https://forsyde.github.io/forsyde-atom) public web page. This page tries to gather the continuously growing list of examples and documents related to the ambitious aforementioned project. 

ForSyDe-Atom is a framework for modeling and simulating cyber-physical systems (CPS), which focuses on disciplined design, by pushing the idea of othogonalization of concerns to its limits. Inheriting much from the functional programming paradigm, it provides a unified framework where each concern (i.e. class of properties such as function, timing, protocol, parallelism, etc.) is expressed within its own environment called *layer*. Each layer defines primitive semantic blocks called *atoms*, hence the framework's name. By composing the atoms in certain *patterns*, we provide a library of building blocks commonly used in CPS design.

We recommend checking the [web page](https://forsyde.github.io/forsyde-atom) and following it for updates which are certain to come soon. Among highlights, we recommend:

 * [The ForSyDe-Atom User Manual](https://forsyde.github.io/forsyde-atom/assets/manual.pdf) which is a living document built regularly from tutorials, examples and experiments. It is currently only in PDF format.
 * [The API documentation](http://forsyde.github.io/forsyde-atom/api/), which also acts as an extended technical report.
