# A new web page for the ForSyDe-SystemC project

We have migrated the former [ForSyDe-SystemC](https://forsyde.github.io/ForSyDe-SystemC/) web pages to the new web site at [forsyde.github.io](https://forsyde.github.io/). A series of [tutorias](https://forsyde.github.io/ForSyDe-SystemC/#documentation) are publicly available (again), along with the [Doxygen generated API documentation](https://forsyde.github.io/ForSyDe-SystemC/api/). While not actively developed at the time being, the [ForSyDe-SystemC](https://forsyde.github.io/ForSyDe-SystemC/) project is still being maintained and plays a significant role within the [ForSyDe tool ecosystem](https://forsyde.github.io/tools.html).
