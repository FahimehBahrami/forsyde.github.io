The new ForSyDe website is up and publicly available at <https://forsyde.github.io/> . Many of the pages are currently under construction and will soon be updated. The former address <https://forsyde.ict.kth.se/> currently points to the old site which is deprecated and is no longer in use. In the following days the old site will be put down and the former address will point to [this website](https://forsyde.github.io/). Until then we warmly recommend you to:

 * subscribe to our [news feed](feed.xml) to keep up to date with the major website changes and with our activities.
 * follow our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/forsyde) for a glimpse on our ongoing projects.
