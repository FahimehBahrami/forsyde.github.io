Since 2019 we have been developing two new entries in the [tools](/tools) ecosystem, based on
lessons learned from previous years and tools. These two entries are [IDeSyDe]({{ idesyde-url }})
and [ForSyDe IO]({{ forsyde-io-url }}). 

[IDeSyDe]({{ idesyde-url }}) is 
the current design space exploration tool in ForSyDe design flow. 
It is based on the concept of design space identification in order to systematically combine and extend different design space exploration scenarios without sacrificing exploration performance.
The accompanying publication, accepted, presented and published in [DATE 2021](https://www.date-conference.com/), can be found [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/DATE51398.2021.9474082) and it is also listed in [publications](/publications).

[ForSyDe IO]({{ forsyde-io-url }}) is the candidate for a common exchange model in the [tools](/tools) ecosystem; as currently not all tools can connect its results to
the inputs of another. The accompanying publication was accepted and presented in [FDL 2022](https://fdl-conference.com/), in Linz, Austria. Once it is also published
in the proceedings of the conference, the publication will be added to the [ForSyDe IO project website]({{ forsyde-io-url }}).

You can follow the active development and specific documemtation for each of these two projects in their websites.
