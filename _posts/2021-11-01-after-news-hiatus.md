It has been a long time since we last posted here. Luckily, it was for all the good reasons!
The major one is research. Sometimes a deep focus is required. And sadly, that might mean long hiatus between front-page updates.

Here are some noteworthy news since Sept. 2019, the date of our last update:

* We published a paper about "*d*esign *s*pace *i*dentification". It is the method that underpines our new *d*esign *s*pace *e*xploration tool: [IDeSyDe]({{ page.idesyde-url }}).
  Here's a quick citation, for your knowledge:
 > JordÃ£o, R.; Sander, I. & Becker, M.
 > Formulation of Design Space Exploration Problems by Composable Design Space Identification 
 > 2021 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2021, 1204-1207 
* We started two new "tool" projects (see one above):
   - [IDeSyDe]({{ page.idesyde-url }}), the new DSE tool from our group after DeSyDe.
   - [ForSyDe-IO]({{ page.forsyde-io-url }}), our "intermediate" model representation supporting libs.
* We are part of two projects that gives our continous knowledge transfer with industry:
   - [ITEA3 PANORAMA](https://panorama-research.org/)
   - [VINNOVA EARLY BIRD](https://www.vinnova.se/en/p/early-bird---seamless-system-design-from-concept-phase-to-implementation/)

To close this brief "I'm alive!" post, it is nice to remind the reader of another place where
a lot of our activity is destined to: [Our organization github](https://github.com/forsyde)!

That's all for now, see you next time!
