A new version of ForSyDe-LaTeX has been released recently. It comes with [extensive documentation](https://forsyde.github.io/forsyde-latex/assets/pdf/refman.pdf) and an all-new [web page](https://forsyde.github.io/forsyde-latex/) with [tutorials](https://forsyde.github.io/forsyde-latex/#getting-started) and [code examples](https://forsyde.github.io/forsyde-latex/#examples).

Among the main features added from the previous version 0.1.0, we can mention:

* `forsyde-plot`, a stable signal plotting package, which plots inline or dumped signal data.
* the Tikz library `forsyde.pictures.layered` for drawing representations of the latered model introduced by [ForSyDe-Atom](https://github.com/forsyde/forsyde-atom).
* updates in the reference manual documenting the new additions.
