A new version of [DeSyDe](https://github.com/forsyde/DeSyDe/tree/v0.3.0-dsd) has been released recently, compatible with and supporting our latest [DSD'18 publication](/publications#RosMoh2018a): _K. Rosvall et al., ‘Exploring Power and Throughput for Dataflow Applications on Predictable NoC Multiprocessors’_.

This version is accompanied by:

* a reproducible set of experiments, as presented in the DSD'18 paper;
* a set of scripts for generating experiments based on the template above, but for different TDN-NoC platform dimensions;
* a hands-on [user tutorial](https://github.com/forsyde/DeSyDe/blob/v0.3.0-dsd/docs/tutorial.md) which guides newcomers through using the tool and interpreting the output.

This release will most likely be stale for a while or will only be followed by minor fixes. At present we are discussing a complete re-design of the tool itself (for scalability and maintainability purpose), which will certainly take significant development effort, so no new major updates are planned for the near future.
